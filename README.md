With an endless combination of modern and legacy browsers for users to choose from (depending on their system capabilities), it's our responsibility as designers and developers to ensure the websites we build perform adequately.

Testing multiple browsers on multiple platforms isn't just difficult â€” it can be virtually impossible without the correct resources. However there are tools that let you comprehensively test your website, and check if it successfully displays across various browsers, platforms and resolutions. That way, your users will receive a positive, user-friendly experience no matter what their setups are.


Below is a curated list of both free and premium cross-browser testing tools, ranging from cloud platforms to desktop applications. These tools will help you easily test everything from versions of Internet Explorer versions to more than 300 modern browser combinations.

<a href="http://vanamco.com/ghostlab/">1. Ghostlab</a>

1-ghostlab
Ghostlab offers synchronized testing for scrolls, clicks, reloads and form input across all your connected devices, meaning you can test the entire user experience, not just a simple page. Using the superior built-in inspector, you can discover and fix problems quickly, connected to the DOM or JavaScript output on any device.

Ghostlab is available for both Windows and Mac OS X, with no setup required, as it can instantly connect to any JavaScript-enabled client. Using the Ghostlab server, you can sync pages from your local directory, your localhost Apache setup or any server in the world, with automatic reloading to keep track of file changes. The workspace feature lets you create a custom browser setup, and adapt Ghostlab's features to exactly what you require.

<a href="http://browsershots.org/">5. Browsershots</a>

5-browsershots
Browsershots is a free, open-source web app providing a convenient way to test your website's browser compatibility in one place. Browsershots uniquely champions the idea of distributing the work of making screenshots among community members, who set up "factories" on their own machines, to get jobs from the server using a fully automatic unattended script.

It's simple to use -- simply enter the URL and choose the browser setup you require. There are several presets to choose from, including screen size, color depth, JavaScript, Java and Flash. You will then have to wait a specified period of time until your request is processed. When the screenshots are ready, they'll appear, and you can bookmark your processing page to come back to it later.

Price: Free - $29.95 per month (Priority Processing)

Once you enter the URL you want to test, you wait until the test is ready, you then have three minutes to review your site in multiple browsers.

There are more than 80 browser combinations to choose from, along with the ability to change the screen resolution. Once your time is up, you'll be asked to re-submit your URL or upgrade to a paid plan, which includes SSH tunnels to access localhost and Intranet services, remote desktop access and higher time limits to test as much as you need.

<a href="http://www.browsera.com/">7. Browsera</a>

7-browsera
Browsera tests cross-browser layout problems by automatically comparing each browser's output and locating and reporting JavaScript errors. You can test pages behind logins, as Browsera can handle logging in prior to running each test, with no installation required (the service runs entirely in the cloud).

Instead of testing single pages, you can test your entire site by crawling the links on your site or accepting a list of URLs you'd like to test. There's support for dynamic content such as AJAX and DHTML, since Browsera waits until the page has finished loading before testing. You're alerted to issues quickly, as possible cross-browser layout problems are immediately flagged and presented.

Price: Free - $99 per month (Premium)

There's no programming knowledge required; just enter a set or URLs and the results are delivered quickly.

You can securely test pages located behind a login or firewall, with a site health report that ensures your live site is configured properly. The screenshot comparison tool is especially helpful, with which you can see how two browsers look in relation to one another -- essential for pixel perfect work. The regression testing also means you never have to worry about whether making a CSS or JavaScript change will break your page.

<a href="http://spoon.net/browsers/">13. Spoon</a>

13-spoon
Spoon.net is a browser sandbox (currently Windows-only) to test or deploy multiple versions of current, beta or legacy web browsers without maintaining cumbersome virtual machines. Just log in, install a small plugin, select the browser you want to test and it will launch instantly. Because Spoon.net runs the applications in isolated "sandboxes," you can run multiple applications side-by-side without any conflicts or dependencies.

The virtual browsers behave exactly like installed browsers, with support for standard browser components such as Java, ActiveX and popular plugins like Firebug, IE Developer Toolbar, and CSS and JavaScript debugging consoles.
